# Resume Scrapper [BE]

This is the backend application for the resume scrapper. It utilizes flask and postgresql to create this app. Utilizing manual regex and natural language processing, it scrapes the resumes and collects the important information.


## Installation

After cloning this backend, first, you will need to create a virtual environment by installing it and running the activate file (The steps are different for windows and MacOS users so search it up).

Once it is running, install all the required modules by running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
To run this application, ensure you are in this projects directory on your bash client and the virtual environment is running. Then simply run:
